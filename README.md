# GitRepBot
an inline telegram bot to query the repositories of a given username.

This is a really simple telegram bot to find and query the repositories of a github account by their username.
forexample for when someone asks you to send them a projects code and you will just use this bot to send them the repo link really fast instead of opening a browser and finding the repo link.

use it like this as an inline chat in any chat:

```@gitrepbot 'username'```
